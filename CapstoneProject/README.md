# Loan Default Prediction

This is the **Capstone Project** from Udacity's Nanodegree *Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree* and its objective is to apply the acquired knowledge to build a ML model and deploy it using an external dataset (i.e. not included in the Azure environment) and in that way emulate a somewhat more realistic scenario.

We will be using the **LendingClub** dataset for borrower failure risk analysis, that is, analysing the factors that contribute to increase or decrease the danger that a *loaner* may default on repaying a loan to the *lender*. The overall goal is to learn how real world problems can be solved, particularly in the context of risk analytics in banking and financial services, using Machine Learning.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

### Prerequisites
To be able to follow along this project on remote compute resources the following steps are needed:

1. Log into your Azure account
2. Create a Workspace
3. Acces the ML Studio
4. Clone or download the notebooks and scripts from this repo: 'hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb', 'automl.ipynb', 'train.py' and 'endpoint.py', and upload them to your working folder in the Studio
5. Download the **LendingClub** dataset from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) and upload it to the Studio
6. [OPTIONAL] Create a folder called "Data" and move the dataset there. The notebooks access the data from this folder, if there is no "Data" folder the code in the notebooks and the 'train.py' script will have to be changed to the path where the dataset is
7. Create a compute instance to run the notebooks
8. Open the jupyter notebooks and run the cells 

### Project Overview
We will train and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using two different methods: **Hyperparameter Tuning using Azure's Hyperdrive** and **Auto Machine Learning**. For the Hyperdrive run, a simple ligistic regression model was chosen. The best model from both approaches is then deployed to be interacted with.

Below is an overview of the workflow:

## Dataset

### Overview

In this project, the *lending club* dataset from the LendingClub American peer-to-peer lending company was used. The purpose is to use data for risk analytics and minimization in a banking and financial context. To achieve that, statistical information about past loan applicants is used to build a model using supervised learning, where the labels are whether or not the applicant failed to fully repay the loan, to be able to predict if a new applicant is likely to repay the loan. The aim is for the model to identify patterns in the dataset that can be used to determine the outcome of the new application based on the financial history of the applicant. In this way, the probability of defaulting the loan can be assessed and lenders can make an informed decision accordingly that may reduce the loss of business for the company by cutting down the credit loss, e.g. by denying the loan, raising interest rates, offering a different loan amount, etc.

Below is a table with all the information available in the dataset for training the model.

### Task
The task at hand is, not only to train an accurate predicitive model using a logistic regression algorithm, but also to gain an insight into the most important features that determine the result yielded by the model. This allows the company to understand which variables are strong indicators of loan default and apply this knowledge in future risk assessment.

### Access
The dataset can be found and downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club). It was then uploaded to the work folder and accessed locally.
