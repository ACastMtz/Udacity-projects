## Dataset

### Overview

In this project, the *lending club* dataset from the LendingClub American peer-to-peer lending company was used. The purpose is to use data for risk analytics and minimization in a banking and financial context. To achieve that, statistical information about past loan applicants is used to build a model using supervised learning, where the labels are whether or not the applicant failed to fully repay the loan, to be able to predict if a new applicant is likely to repay the loan. The aim is for the model to identify patterns in the dataset that can be used to determine the outcome of the new application based on the financial history of the applicant. In this way, the probability of defaulting the loan can be assessed and lenders can make an informed decision accordingly that may reduce the loss of business for the company by cutting down the credit loss, e.g. by denying the loan, raising interest rates, offering a different loan amount, etc.

Below is a table with all the inormation available in the dataset for training the model.

### Task
The task at hand is therefore, not only to train an accurate predicitive model usin a logistic regression algorithm, but also to gain an insight into the most important features that determine the result yielded by the model. This allows the company to understand which variables are strong indicators of loan default and apply this knowledge in future risk assessment.

### Access
The dataset was uploaded to the work folder and access locally.
## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
