    "In this project, the *lending club* dataset from the LendingClub American peer-to-peer lending company was used. The purpose is to use data for risk analytics and minimization in a banking and financial context. To achieve that, statistical information about past loan applicants is used to build a model using supervised learning, where the labels are whether or not the applicant failed to fully repay the loan, to be able to predict if a new applicant is likely to repay the loan. The aim is for the model to identify patterns in the dataset that can be used to determine the outcome of the new application based on the financial history of the applicant. In this way, the probability of defaulting the loan can be assessed and lenders can make an informed decision accordingly that may reduce the loss of business for the company by cutting down the credit loss, e.g. by denying the loan, raising interest rates, offering a different loan amount, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task at hand is therefore, not only to train an accurate predicitive model using a logistic regression algorithm for classification, but also to gain an insight into the most important features that determine the result yielded by the model. This allows the company to understand which variables are strong indicators of loan default and apply this knowledge in future risk assessment.\n",
