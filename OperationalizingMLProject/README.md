# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project aims to provide an overview on how to create a cloud-based ML model and the production process from loading the dataset till consumption of the deployed model. Once again, the UCI Bank Marketing dataset was used to train a model to predict if a client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit with the bank.

## Key Steps
1. User Authentication: The first step is to provide the credentials and authentication required for logging into the Azure platform. However, this is not required (or even possible) when using the virtual lab offered by Udacity to work on the project. 

2. Dataset: Next step is to upload the Bank Marketing dataset to the Azure MK Studio so that it can be used to train the auto ML model.
