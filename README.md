# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
In this project, the UCI Bank Marketing dataset was used to predict if a client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit with the bank.

To that end, the parameters of a Scikit-learn logistic regression model were automatically optimized using the HyperDrive package from the Azure Machine Learning studio with the Python SDK.

Additionally, an AutoML pipeline was used to train and tune a model on the same dataset to afterwards compare the results from both methods.

In both cases the target metric was the model's "Accuracy".

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
